- Sends you email notifications when someone wants to connect
- Works on mobile and desktop

### What It Costs:

**Development Cost:** Already included in Professional & Enterprise packages

**Monthly Platform Cost (you pay this separately):**

| Platform | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Tawk.to** (Recommended) | **FREE forever** | Unlimited chats, basic AI responses |
| **Tidio** | ₹0-2,000 | Up to 50 chats free, then paid |
| **Crisp** | ₹2,000-2,500 | Unlimited chats, 2 users |

**My Recommendation:** Start with **Tawk.to (FREE)**. It works great for most businesses. If you need more features later, upgrade to Crisp.

> 💡 **Simple Explanation:** We build and set up the chatbot for you (included in package price). You pay the chatbot platform separately each month - similar to paying for email service.
